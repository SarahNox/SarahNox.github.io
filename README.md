This repo shall display a small functioning tic-tac-toe with a Star-Wars-Theme.

## Motivation

This game is just to fill in time when waiting f.e. for a colleague to finish a task before heading out for lunch when not having enough time to start with a new task yourself.

## Problems / Mistakes

My Git commits were not small and descriptive. I have to work on that as it will be difficult to fix now. Before adding anything now I have to pay more attention on that topic.
